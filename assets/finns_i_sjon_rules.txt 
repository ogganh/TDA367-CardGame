Rules – Go Fish

Start:
   - Each player begins with 7 cards.
   - The remaining cards are placed in the draw pile – the “pond”.

Your Turn:
   - You may ask any player for a rank you have in your hand, e.g. “Do you have any Kings?”
   - If the player has cards of that rank, they must give you all of them and you continue your turn.

Go Fish:
   - If the player does not have the rank, they respond with “Go Fish!”
   - You then draw 1 card from the pond.
   - After drawing, your turn always ends and the next player takes their turn.

How to Win:
   - Collect four cards of the same rank to complete a set.
   - Each set is worth 1 point.
   - The player with the most sets wins the game.

End of the Game:
   - The game ends when the pond is empty and all sets have been collected.
